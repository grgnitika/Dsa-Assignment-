Assignment: Graph-Based Recommendation System for a Social Media Application

Task Description:
The task is to design and implement a graph-based recommendation system for a social media
application, inspired by platforms such as TikTok. The application should utilize graph algorithms and user interactions to provide personalized content recommendations to users based on their interests and network connections.

The major requiremnts of the application are as follows:
Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using a suitable GUI framework, such as Java Swing or JavaFX, to create an interactive social media application.
Implement a graph data structure that represents the social network, with nodes representing users and edges representing connections or interactions between users.
Provide functionality for users to create accounts, follow other users, and interact with content (e.g., liking, commenting, sharing).
Implement an algorithm to track user interactions and build a user profile based on their interests, preferences, and network connections.
Design and implement a recommendation algorithm that utilizes graph traversal and analysis techniques to suggest personalized content to users.
Consider factors such as user preferences, content popularity, and network influence in the recommendation algorithm to provide diverse and engaging recommendations.
Implement a user interface that displays recommended content to users based on their profile and interactions.
Allow users to provide feedback on recommended content, such as liking or disliking, to further refine the recommendation system.
Optimize the recommendation algorithm and data structures to handle large-scale social networks efficiently, considering factors such as memory usage and computational complexity.
Test the application with a simulated user base and interactions to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation system and the responsiveness of the GUI.
Consider implementing additional features to enhance the social media application, such as content filtering, user search, or real-time content updates.
